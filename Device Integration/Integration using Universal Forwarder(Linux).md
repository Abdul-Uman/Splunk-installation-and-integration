2.splunkweb is not applicable for the Universal Forwarder as it does not include a web interface in Linux.

## Next Steps:

1.If the status indicates that Splunk is running smoothly, you can proceed with configuring data inputs to start forwarding data to your Splunk instance.

2.If there are any issues (e.g., splunkd is not running), you should troubleshoot by checking the logs or restarting the Universal Forwarder.
